# W01D04 - Callbacks!

### To Do
- [x] Functions as values
- [x] Function calling vs function passing
- [x] Callbacks and higher order functions
- [x] Anonymous functions
- [x] Arrow functions
- [x] Make our own higher order function

Array Methods:
* forEach => do something for each element inside the array
* map => returns an array the same length as input array with the elements transformed
* filter => "removes" elements from the input array
* reduce => "reduces" an array down to a single value


callback - a function that gets passed to another func to be invoked by that function
higher order function (HOF) - a function that accepts another func as an argument OR a function that returns a function


event handler - code that runs when a particular event occurs


callback heck

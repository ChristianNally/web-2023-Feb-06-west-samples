# W02D01 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] Chai assertion library
- [x] What is TDD?
- [x] Practice unit testing

### Testing
* Manual - programmer manually runs the code
* Unit - testing the smallest pieces of your code (functions)
  * what did we get actually back vs what did we expect to get back

### Assertion
* forceful statement of fact or belief

### Test Runner
* a framework for running tests
* create callback functions that contain our test code

### NPM
* package manager
* responsible for installing packages onto our system

```bash
npm install mocha # install as a dependency of our project
npm install --save-dev mocha # install as a dev dependency of our project
npm install --global mocha # install globally

# manually add to the package.json file
```
